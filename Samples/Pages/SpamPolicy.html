                    <li>Do <strong>NOT</strong> export your entire email address book into MailChimp. There

                        like: tech support contacts from companies you’ve requested help from (techies get
                        really mad when they receive emails from people they don’t recognize, and they know
                        how to report you for it, fast), and companies who’ve sent you email order receipts,
                        etc</li>
                    <li>Emails that you "scraped" (either manually or automatically) from other websites</li>
                    <li>You may not send personal resumes to potential employers. They did not opt in to
                        receive emails from you.</li>
                    <li>Recipients whose emails you collected without their permission, but you think they
                        could really use your product or service, and you think they'd really want to hear
                        from you.</li>
                    <li>Members of a group/organization who never asked for your emails (even if you're
                        a member of the group)</li>
                    <li>Emails collected by Facebook Login. You can only send to those email addresses through
                        Facebook, not Kooboo Communicator. Signing into your App with Facebook does not necessarily
                        equal permission to be added to a mailing list.</li>

                        no idea they were going to receive emails (because you didn't say that on the fishbowl).</li>
